dumb-go-soap-client is a very small SOAP client interface for Golang.

Gowsdl provides a great way to generate Go structures that are
marshaled/unmarshaled into SOAP request content, and functions that will
perform SOAP requests as specified in the WSDL.

However, some applications may not want to use these autogenerated structs,
and may want to specify their own (with custom field names, for instance). The
same goes for methods: applications may want to send a SOAP request directly,
without being wrapped around confusing WSDL function names.

While all of these goals would be achieved by tweaking gowsdl's autogenerated
code, it is a saner way to achieve these goals with a package like this one,
that borrows SOAP request logic from Gowsdl but makes the application do
everything else (for applications that *want* to do everything else).

This SOAPClient is still *more* limited that gowsdl's, and is still in early
development.
